# blog-app
Final project submission for the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open MOOC 2020

We worked on this project throughout most of the course implementing functionality as we went. The course material would teach us basic concepts through a lesson project, we would then need to be able to take those concepts learned and apply them to this separate project. This app employs the MERN stack, that is: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js languages.
