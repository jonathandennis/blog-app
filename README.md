Final project submission for the University of Helsinki Full Stack Open MOOC 2020

https://jd-blog-saver.herokuapp.com/

I worked on this project throughout most of the course implementing functionality as we went. The course material would teach us basic concepts through a lesson project, we would then need to be able to take those concepts covered and apply them to this separate project. This app employs the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js languages. 

<<blog-list app>>
  
  Use this app to list your favorite blogs/webpages.<br />
  Only logged in users can submit new entries.<br />
  Entries are listed by number of likes.<br />
  Each entry is assigned to the user that added it, and visible to all. An entry can only be deleted by the user who added it.<br />
  Click on any entry on the list to review it on its own page. This page contains the user, title, author, and url information. Functionality for liking the entry, along with         leaving a comment is available here too.<br />
  The users page lists each user along with the number of entries submitted.<br />
